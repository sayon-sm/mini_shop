# Simple E-Commerce Product List

###### This application displays a list of products, each with a name, price, description, and image.

###### Users can add products to their CART, and the total price is updated dynamically. An alert appears to notify the user which product has been added.

###### User can click "Order Now!" button to place an order. An alert appears, and all the products in the CART are displayed in the console.
